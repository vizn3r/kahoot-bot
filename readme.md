# Kahoot Bot by ANEL

## Game Pin

- This is pin, that your **game host provided** you

- For instance "`978 45`"

## Bot Count:

- Number of bots
- Please, take note of that there won't connect 100% of the bots, because of ratelimits
- Maximum number of bots is limited to your room max users (non-premium accounts have 50)

- Default is *1*

## Quiz ID:

- This is **required** when you want correct answers

### 1st method
 1. To get this id, look at game host's browser link, it should look like this:
```
https://create.kahoot.it/details/cf6045ff-4ba3-41be-b08b-ff09e8368aad
```
 2. Required id is that long string after `../details/`, copy it and enter into prompt

### 2nd method (my preffered)
 1. Go to **https://kahoot.com**
 2. Log in or register
 3. Search for the **exact same** quiz that your teacher did
 4. Copy the id from the web link and enter into prompt
